- In this tableau visualization, it contains 4 plots from uber pickup data in New York from April to September, and the weather data from April to July. 
The first figure shows the total uber trip per day. X axis is the date, and y is the number of trips in each day. Each line refers to the TLC base company code affiliated with the Uber pickup. 

- The base company in blue and orange lines provided increased services at uber pickup from April to September. The total uber services were also expanded from spring to summer. 

- If you look at the variation of figure ‘Journeys by Day’, it was easily found that weather is a strong impact. For most of the case, the lower uber use refer to a clear weather, while a sharp increased peak refers to a weather of raining, fog, snow, or thunderstorm. 

- From the figure of ‘journeys by hour’, it shows the same trend of different base company. There are peaks around 6-8 am and ~ 5pm, which is the weekday’s on and off time. If we select one of the peaks, we can see the similar pattern of base company in Figure 1. The lower value refers to the weekend. 

- With the increase of the uber pickup, we can find the service area is expanded from Apr to September.
